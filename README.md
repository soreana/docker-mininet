## TIPS

### Open X Window applications in containers (can't work if you are running containers on OS without UI)

> this feature doesn't work in remote servers as a result I removed it.

If you could not open `xterm` or other X Window applications, or faced to the
following error message;

```bash
root@26f36691a400:~# xterm
No protocol specified
Warning: This program is an suid-root program or is being run by the root user.
The full text of the error or warning message cannot be safely formatted
in this environment. You may get a more descriptive message by running the
program as a non-root user or by removing the suid bit on the executable.
xterm: Xt error: Can't open display: %s
```

Please add `root` user to the local access control list of xhost on your
"Docker host" (not on your containers).

```bash
$ xhost +si:localuser:root
localuser:root being added to access control list
```
